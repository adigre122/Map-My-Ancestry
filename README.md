# Map My Ancestry

#### Video Demo:  Check out a [demo](<URL HERE>) to see Map My Ancestry in action.

#### Map My Ancestry is a simple Python application that allows you to visualize the locations of your ancestors on a map based on the information provided by a GEDCOM file and an input year. This application utilizes the 'tkintermapview' library for the map view and 'ttkbootstrap' for styling.

## Features
- **Interactive Map View**: The map view displays markers representing the locations of individuals based on their birthplaces or residences. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out. You can also use a scroll wheel or pinch/pull gestures on a trackpad to zoom in or out.

- **Location Considerations**: The application considers the years individuals lived to determine if they were living during the user's input year. If so, the Map My Ancestry will consider the ancestors' residential timeline information and birthplace.

- **Important Things to Consider**: This application will resort to plotting markers of the birthplace of the ancestors if no residential information can be found. 

## Future Versions

Potential enhancements in future releases:
- Preload map for faster processing
- Offline loading of the map tiles
- Buttons to change the map styling
